# + Android Notes:

# When to request an in-app review

Follow these guidelines to help you decide when to request in-app reviews from users:

- Trigger the in-app review flow after a user has experienced enough of your app or game to provide useful feedback.
- Do not prompt the user excessively for a review. This approach helps minimize user frustration and limit API usage (see the section on quotas).
- Your app should not ask the user any questions before or while presenting the rating button or card, including questions about their opinion (such as “Do you like the app?”) or predictive questions (such as “Would you rate this app 5 stars”).

# Quotas

To provide a great user experience, Google Play enforces a quota on how often a user can be shown the review dialog. Because of this, calling a launchReviewFlow method might not always display a dialog. For example, you should not have a call-to-action option (such as a button) to trigger a review as a user might have already hit their quota and the flow won’t be shown, presenting a broken experience to the user.

# Device requirements

In-app reviews only work on the following devices:

- Android devices (phones and tablets) running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher that have the Google Play Store installed.
- Chrome OS devices that have the Google Play Store installed.

# Please Note, To test your integration using the Google Play Store

- In-app reviews require your app to be published in Play Store. However, you can test your integration without publishing your app to production using either internal test tracks or internal app sharing.

# + iOS Notes:

# System Rating and Review Prompts

The system offers a consistent, nonintrusive way for apps to request ratings and reviews. To use this feature, you simply identify places in your app's user experience where it makes sense to ask for feedback. If the user hasn't already given feedback, the system displays an in-app prompt that asks for a rating and an optional written review. The user can supply feedback or dismiss the prompt with a single tap. (In Settings, the user can also opt out of receiving these rating prompts for all apps they have installed.) The system automatically limits the display of the prompt to three occurrences per app within a 365-day period.



# When to request an in-app-review 

- Ask for a rating only after the user has demonstrated engagement with your app. For example, prompt the user upon the completion of a game level or productivity task. Never ask for a rating on first launch or during onboarding. Allow ample time to form an opinion.

- Don’t interrupt the user, especially when they’re performing a time-sensitive or stressful task. Look for logical pauses or stopping points, where a rating request makes the most sense.

- Don’t be a pest. Repeated rating prompts can be irritating, and may even negatively influence the user’s opinion of your app. Allow at least a week or two between rating requests and only prompt again after the user has demonstrated additional engagement with your app.

- Don't use buttons or other controls to request feedback. Since the system limits how often rating prompts occur, attempting to request feedback in response to a control may result in no rating prompt being displayed.

# Please Note, To test your integration using the App Store

- When you call this method while your app is still in development mode, a rating/review request view is always displayed so that you can test the user interface    and experience. However, this method has no effect when you call it in an app that you distribute using TestFlight.


## How to test your code

Because it's a native module, you might need to mock this package to run your tests.
Here is an example for Jest, adapt it to your needs :

```js
// __mocks__/react-native-in-app-review.js

module.exports = {
  RequestInAppReview: jest.fn(),
  isAvailable: jest.fn(),
  // add more methods as needed
};

```
